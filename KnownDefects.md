# Human Rights First - Asylum - Front End - Application

- This document contains the known defects and or bugs for the Front End. To return to the main documentation [click here](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/human-rights-first-asylum-fe-a)

### Bugs
- In MangageCases.js: 
  1. When you click the expanded view button, everything opens
  2. When you approve or reject a case, it does not refresh state
- The progress bar can be removed on the 'Case Upload' component
- On the judges page when you click on Approval Rate / Denial Rate the application breaks.
- ReviewCasesForm only has the role "user" and "admin", but I believe that there are supposed to be 3 different options. Not sure if someone has figured out the differences in access to the three.

### Styling Colors

- Primary Action color: #3f51b5
- Seconday "Disabled" color: #7f9bb3

### Key Features and Notes to the Next Group

- Other know bugs and not working features can be seen on this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MTRA2X88MW4GwFX9NdmO_qqHEDqGHxj20Q0DWplD29E/edit?usp=sharing), feel free to copy it

- Our data science team had issues hooking up their database to our backend, so we never had a populated database. As a result of this all of the Axios requests are made to a locally hosted version of the backend. Thse will obviously all have to be changed once there is a hosted backend with actual data in it.

- Table can be searched by column parameters and sorted by clicking on column headers

- Cases and Judges can be saved to a user profile by checking their row's select box and clicking the save button

  - This will add them to the saved cases or saved judges page

- All Tables should let you go to a specfic page by clicking either case ID or Judge Name

- PDF viewer pops up a model, minor visual bugs may appear

- Clicking on a judge name in the judge table will take you to a page with some expanded info and basic plots
  -This judge page needs styling work (JudgePage.js)
  -Other than the pie chart, the formulas for the other sample charts are hard coded and will need to be fixed once the database is actually populated beyond test data
